# Audio_Transcription_Using_WhisperAI

1. Problem Statement
In a world dominated by digital audio—ranging from podcasts to recorded lectures and meetings—manual transcription is time-consuming and error-prone. Users require an efficient, accurate, and user-friendly transcription tool. The challenge is to create a web-based application capable of accepting audio files, processing them with high accuracy, and producing text output with minimal latency and technical setup. OpenAI's Whisper, a powerful speech-to-text model, provides a potential solution when paired with an intuitive front-end like Streamlit.
2. Goals and Scope
Primary Goal:
To develop a user-centric web application that performs accurate and high-fidelity speech-to-text conversion.
Scope:
Support for common audio formats (MP3 and WAV)
Built-in audio preprocessing (resampling and conversion)
Integration with Whisper’s inference pipeline
Option to download the resulting transcript (e.g., .srt format)
Target Audience:
Content creators, educators, researchers, journalists, accessibility advocates, and professionals seeking fast, reliable audio transcription with minimal setup.
3. Requirements
Functional Requirements
Upload .mp3 or .wav files
Preprocess audio into 16 kHz mono using Librosa
Transcribe audio using OpenAI Whisper
Display transcribed text in the UI
Provide option to download transcript as .srt
Show spinner/progress during transcription
Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Transcribe ~5-minute files in under 1 minute on standard systems
Usability: Interface accessible to non-technical users
Compatibility: Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
Security: Temporary files auto-deleted post-processing
Maintainability: Modular, documented codebase
Scalability: Extensible to cloud-based/multi-user setups
Reliability: Conflict-free temporary file handling using Python's tempfile module
